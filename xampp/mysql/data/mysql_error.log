240204 17:38:10 [ERROR] mysqld got exception 0xc0000005 ;
This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB source revision: c8f2e9a5c0ac5905f28b050b7df5a9ffd914b7e7
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=3
max_threads=65537
thread_count=7
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB source revision: c8f2e9a5c0ac5905f28b050b7df5a9ffd914b7e7
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=2
max_threads=65537
thread_count=7
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB source revision: c8f2e9a5c0ac5905f28b050b7df5a9ffd914b7e7
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=2
max_threads=65537
thread_count=7
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB source revision: c8f2e9a5c0ac5905f28b050b7df5a9ffd914b7e7
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=2
max_threads=65537
thread_count=7
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.
